                        <h3>Comfortable Living</h3>
                        <p>The hotel was very good. It's located on the main road. The biggest thing which I liked is they have carpet in each rooms. Also swimming pool is nice and they have a swing which is good in the garden. My kiddo loved the swing. The food was also very good.</p>

                        <h3>Nice Place</h3>
                        <p> We were looking for a great stay experience, what with staying locked up of 18 months without going anywhere! And did this tick all the boxes! The best part about it is the warm ness of the staff, at every level. The sense of complete ownership of any request that is made, the concerned staff member takes it to completion. While they talk about �Haridwar�, we experienced it!</p>
